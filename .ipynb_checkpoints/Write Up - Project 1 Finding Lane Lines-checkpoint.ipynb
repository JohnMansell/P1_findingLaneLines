    "The main goal of the project is to determine the location of the lane lines on the road, and then project them back onto the original picture. Once the location is determined, drawing the lines it executed by the \"draw_lane_lines\" function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before \"draw_lane_lines\" can be called, the function \"extrapolate_lines\" takes in the array of all the different line edges found in the image, separates them by slope and y intercept, and aggregates the partial lines into two distinct lane lines extrapolated from the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"draw_lane_lines\" function then takes in three parameters; the original image, and the right and left lane lines in standard form. For each line, draw_lane_lines finds the x-intercept and the intersection of the two lines. Then the two lines are drawn on a blank image the same size as the original. The line segments each start at the bottom of the picture and extend up to their intersection. Finally, the lane lines are projected back onto the original image."

    "### 2. Potential Shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As I've been working on this project, I've noticed a number of situations while driving that would be difficult for this pipeline to handle:\n",
    "* Curves on the road\n",
    "* Sections of the road with no lane lines\n",
    "* Places where old lane lines are still visable\n",
    "* Sharp and distinct shadow lines on the road, or seams in the concrete\n",
    "* Distinguishing the middle divider from other lane lines\n",
    "* Writing on the road that would show up as clear lines and distort the slope of the aggregate lines\n",
    "* Vertical barriers separating one lane from another\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the main shortcoming of this pipeline is that it is not as intelligent as a person in separating out what is a lane line, and what is some other line. Other sharp lines in the image can easily throw off the results. Also, it assumes the lane lines will be best fit to a straight line, but not a curve, or even a hill. "
